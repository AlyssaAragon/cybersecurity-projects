# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This is my collection of practical, hands-on cybersecurity projects designed to demonstrate key skills in offensive security, defensive operations, cloud security, malware analysis, and more.

I'm actively building this portfolio to transition into a cybersecurity career. These projects use real tools, simulate real threats, and solve real problems.
